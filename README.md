## üîç Overview

This project aims to build a predictive model for residential house prices using various structural and categorical features. The goal is to assist real estate platforms, buyers, and sellers in estimating property values accurately using data-driven insights.

The solution includes:
- Data exploration and cleaning
- Feature encoding and scaling
- Training and comparing two regression models
- Model evaluation using MAE and RMSE
- Visualization of predictions and feature importance

## üìÅ Dataset

The dataset used is **"Housing.csv"**, commonly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashydv/housing-dataset). It contains 545 entries with the following key columns:
- `price`: Target variable (house price in INR)
- `area`: Built-up area in square feet
- `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `stories`: Number of rooms
- `mainroad`, `prefarea`, `airconditioning`: Binary location/amenity features
- `furnishingstatus`: Categorical (furnished, semi-furnished, unfurnished)
- `parking`: Number of parking spaces

## üß© Features Used

| Feature | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `area` | Numerical | Built-up area in sq. ft |
| `bedrooms` | Numerical | Number of bedrooms |
| `bathrooms` | Numerical | Number of bathrooms |
| `stories` | Numerical | Number of floors |
| `parking` | Numerical | Number of parking spots |
| `mainroad` | Binary | Proximity to main road |
| `prefarea` | Binary | Preferred residential area |
| `airconditioning` | Binary | Has AC or not |
| `furnishingstatus` | Categorical | Furnishing level |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Preprocessing Steps

1. **Label Encoding** for binary features:  
   `mainroad`, `prefarea`, `airconditioning`
2. **Categorical Encoding** for `furnishingstatus` using `.cat.codes`
3. **Standardization** of all numerical features using `StandardScaler`
4. **Train-Test Split**: 80% training, 20% testing (`random_state=42`)

## ü§ñ Models Trained

| Model | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Linear Regression** | Baseline linear model |
| **Gradient Boosting Regressor** | Ensemble tree-based model with hyperparameter tuning |

---

## üìä Evaluation Metrics

Both models were evaluated using:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Average absolute difference between predicted and actual prices
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Emphasizes larger errors

## üìà Results

| Model | MAE | RMSE |
|------|-----|------|
| **Linear Regression** | ‚Çπ23,75,000 | ‚Çπ30,40,000 |
| **Gradient Boosting** | ‚Çπ10,92,000 | ‚Çπ14,78,000 |

## üñºÔ∏è Visualizations

### 1. Actual vs Predicted Prices
*Scatter plots comparing actual and predicted prices for both models.*

### 2. Feature Importance (Gradient Boosting)
*Top features influencing house prices: `area`, `bathrooms`, and `airconditioning` are most significant.*
